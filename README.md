- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonah, last name Saysourivong. I'm 28 years old and started stuying computer science in 2019, I absolutely love this field and I'm fascinted with where it's going. 
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and problem solving. I do a lot of leetcoding and I play boardgames on my freetime (I do a lot more than this).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development using ASP.NET CORE and NODE.js simultaneously. I'm a sernior at Sacramento Sate Univeristy of Sacramento and I need to learn ASP.NET CORE for my senior project so that I can build an light-weight, secure web application for my client and NODE.js because I want to find out what all the fus is about.
- 💞️ I have a couple of ideas of personal projects I would like to colloborate on.
  1) Web site informing, creatively showing, and providing interactive ways to learn about how personal data in the IoT is mined, processes, and used.
  2) Virtual boardgame in isometric view with 2-dimensional graphics. I'm not incredible at front-end but as far as game mechanics and backend I believe I would excel.
